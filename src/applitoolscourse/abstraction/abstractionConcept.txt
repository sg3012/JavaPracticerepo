1. Abstraction is a concept in Java which provides high level definitions
   of Classes and methods.
2. Abstraction can be defined as something that exists in theory
   but doesn't have a concrete implementation i.e., something
   defined abstract cannot be used as is there has to be a concrete 
   implementation of that thing to perform various operations.
3. The concrete implementation of abstract classes and methods 
   is done by using inheritance.    
4. JAVA has a keyword abstract to implement Abstraction concept. The 
   keyword "abstract" is a non-access modifier.
5. Abstract classes in JAVA cannot be instantiated instead they can be 
   extended by child classes.
6. A subclass must override all abstract methods of an abstract class
7. Abstract class has a body that contains only method declarations.
8. The methods which are thus declared in abstract classes are 
   usually abstract methods. Abstract methods do not have 
   a body just the declaration header.
9. Abstract methods are designed to be overriden in sub-classes 
   providing specific implementations.No body should be 
   there in abstract methods.
